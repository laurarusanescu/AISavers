## Summary

Ocular is a small budgeting app as an alternative to Google sheet's annual budget planner.
Its goal is **not** to track individual expenses, work with multiple currencies at a time or anything related (if you're looking for something like this, check out [firefly-iii](https://www.firefly-iii.org/)).

This app comes with its own backend (by using [genesis](https://github.com/simonwep/genesis)), so the only thing you need to do is to host it somewhere.
Your data stays on your server and is not shared with anyone else.

## Getting started

### Production

Best deploy this app via [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
See [ocular-docker](https://github.com/simonwep/ocular-docker) for deployment.
Don't worry, it'll only take a few minutes to set everything up.
